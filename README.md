# The Perfect Monorepo! (based on my questionable technical decisions)

*A complete, minimal, type-safe starter for modern web software. No overengineering, no legacy, just velocity.*

## 🧰 What's Inside

This monorepo gives you a rock-solid base for fullstack development:

### 🕸 Web

> Located in `apps/web/`

* **React 19** – Concurrent, modern, built to last
* **Vite** – Lightning-fast build/dev
* **Tailwind CSS 4** – Utility-first styling
* **TanStack Router** – File-based routing, no magic
* **TanStack Query** – The right way to fetch
* **Shadcn UI** – Radix-powered headless UI layer
* **Recharts** – Dashboard-ready charts
* **React Hook Form + Zod** – Schema-first forms
* **Kubb** – Typed API clients via OpenAPI
* **Clerk React** – Fullstack authentication and authorization, session sync via cookies

### ⚙️ API

> Located in `apps/api/`

* **Elysia** – Fast, expressive Bun-native backend
* **Drizzle ORM + TypeBox** – SQL-first with strong typing
* **PostgreSQL** – Just works
* **Swagger** – Docs you can share without shame
* **Clerk Backend SDK** – Simple user validation and session verification

### 🧱 Tooling

* **Bun** – Unified package manager, runtime, and bundler
* **Biome** – All-in-one formatter and linter
* **Turborepo** – Caching and orchestration done right

## 🏃 Getting Started

```bash
bun install # installs all dependencies in all apps
bun setup:env # sets up .env files for all apps
bun gen # generates front-end services for consuming the API
bun dev # starts both frontend and backend in dev mode
```

Use `bun run build` in individual apps for production builds.

## 🔐 Authentication

### Frontend

* Automatically handled via **Clerk React**.
* API client generated by **Kubb** injects the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the `__session` cookie automatically — no need to manually pass tokens.
* Session sync is handled by Clerk via secure, http-only cookies.

### Backend

* Secured via **Clerk Backend SDK**.
* Middleware `ClerkAuth` verifies incoming requests:

  * Extracts session token from `Authorization` header or cookies.
  * Validates session and retrieves the full user object.
  * Injects user context into the request lifecycle.

Example usage in API:

```ts
app.use(ClerkAuth)

app.get('/api/profile', ({ user }) => {
  return `Hello, ${user.firstName}`
})
```

No need for repetitive token extraction or validation logic.

## 🐳 Docker

Each app can be containerized separately. Example:

```bash
# Web
docker build -t web apps/web
docker run -p 3000:80 web

# API
docker build -t api apps/api
docker run -p 8000:8000 api
```

## 🗂 Structure

```

│   └── api/     # Elysia backend
├── turbo.json   # Pipeline config

└── README.md
```

## ✨ Philosophy

This stack aims for:

* **Type safety everywhere** – Zod, Drizzle, TypeBox, TypeScript-first
* **Minimal global state** – Favor explicit data flow
* **Separation of concerns** – No blurred lines between routing, logic, and data
* **Developer sanity** – Fast tooling, zero-config DX, predictable file structure
* **Fullstack auth without complexity** – Clerk handles both frontend and backend seamlessly

## 🧠 Final Note

If you need more than this to ship an MVP, you’re solving the wrong problem.
If you keep this clean, you’re building something worth keeping.
